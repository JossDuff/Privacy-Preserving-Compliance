## Tech Stack

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity** - Verifier contracts and example applications
- **EVM** - deployments will be made to the Sepolia testnet

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- **Noir** - ZK circuit DSL for compliance definitions

### Backend/Tooling
- **Rust** - Regulator CLI
- **js** - proof manager
- **IPFS** - Decentralized storage for compliance definitions

---

## Components

### 1. Regulator Cli

Enable regulators to create, publish, and update compliance definitions

**Deliverables**:
- CLI for compliance definition management
- Example compliance circuits (sanctions list, account age, etc.)
- Verifier contract deployment system
- IPFS publishing integration

**Key Functionality**:
- Sign compliance definitions with regulator private key
- Deploy verifier contracts with aggregation support
- Update existing compliance definitions (constraints or parameters)
- Upload to IPFS and manage metadata

### 2. User Proof Manager

Enable users to generate compliance proofs efficiently

**Deliverables**:
- Use Noir js library for proof generation
- Transaction history indexing
- Constraint inference engine
- Proof caching system

**Key Functionality**:
- Fetch compliance definition from IPFS or direct input
- Verify regulator signatures
- Index user transaction history
- Fetch public proof inputs from verifier contract
- Generate individual constraint proofs
- Aggregate proofs into compliance definition proof
- Cache and reuse previously generated proofs

### 3. Example Applications

Demonstrate framework integration

**Deliverables**:
- Compliant ERC20 Stablecoin or Compliant Transaction Mixer (Tornado Cash fork)
- Example frontend

**Integration Pattern**:
```solidity
function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes proof) {
    require(verifierContract.verify(proof), "Not compliant");
    // ... rest of transfer logic
}
```
